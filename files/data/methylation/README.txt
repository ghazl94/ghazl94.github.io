Dataset description: 
the dataset contains CpG methylation values per CpG and per individual as a table (“MethylDataWithDbgapId.txt”). Each column is an individual and each row is a CpG, values in the table are methylation values.

“subjects.txt” has the information on the individuals. Most important attribute here is the age. The ids (db gap ids) in this table should match the columns on the first table. There are other attributes such as sex and Race, they can also be important. 

Problem: 
Main question is what is the relationship between age and methylation?

0) Which strategies/methods can be used to test these ideas on this data set ? 
[list some methods and how they can be used to text this. Give software package names that can be used for the strategies you mention]


1) Is methylation predictive of age (previous research indicates so)?  
[pick one strategy from 0 and implement it to answer the question above

2) Are all CpGs associated with age? if not, which CpGs are more important for age prediction?



You can use any resource that you want, prepare a small report answering the questions above. You can of course use any resources to get ideas. There are many different avenues to tackle this problem. The report should include text, code and figures.
